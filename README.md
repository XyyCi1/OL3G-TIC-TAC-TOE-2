a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Players alternate placing X's and O's, aiming to achieve three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before their opponent. This deceptively simple game demonstrates core principles of logic, foresight, and decision-making.
